Wisty.js is a JavaScript natural language processing library to build contextual chatbots or virtual assistants on the web.

It supports training and inference in Node.js and modern browsers. You can integrate a bot into your front-end without having to rely on some infrastructure or a cloud service.

Wisty uses machine learning to translate your user's queries into actions and to reduce the amount of code you need to write to handle context.

It's powered by a modified implementation of [Hybrid Code Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03274) using TensorFlow.js.

**Project Status:** *Unreleased public alpha* (The code is available but without documentation at this point)
