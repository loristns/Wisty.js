Wisty.js is a JavaScript natural language processing library to build contextual chatbots or virtual assistants on the web.

- Powered by machine learning thanks to [TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs)

- Supports training and inference in Node.js and most browsers : you can integrate a bot into your front-end without having to rely on some infrastructure or a cloud service

- Your bot learns from dialogs : It reduces the amount of hardcoded logic you have to write New features are just a few training samples away.
